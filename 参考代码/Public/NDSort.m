function [FrontNo,MaxFNo] = NDSort(varargin)
%NDSort - Do non-dominated sorting by efficient non-dominated sort (ENS)
%
%   FrontNo = NDSort(F,s) does non-dominated sorting on F, where F is the
%   matrix of objective values of a set of individuals, and s is the number
%   of individuals to be sorted at least. FrontNo(i) denotes the front
%   number of the i-th individual. The individuals have not been sorted are
%   assigned a front number of inf.
%
%   FrontNo = NDSort(F,C,s) does the non-dominated sorting based on
%   constrained-domination, where C is the matrix of constraint values of
%   the individuals. In this case, feasible solutions always dominate
%   infeasible solutions, and one infeasible solution dominates another
%   infeasible solution if the former has a smaller overall constraint
%   violation than the latter.
%
%   In particular, s = 1 indicates finding only the first non-dominated
%   front, s = size(A,1)/2 indicates sorting only half of the population
%   (which is often used in the algorithm), and s = inf indicates sorting
%   the whole population.
%
%   [FrontNo,K] = NDSort(...) also returns the maximum front number besides
%   inf.
%
%   Example:
%       [FrontNo,MaxFNo] = NDSort(PopObj,1)
%       [FrontNo,MaxFNo] = NDSort(PopObj,PopCon,inf)
